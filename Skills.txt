1st Circle (Adamant) ^ As Crusaders prove themselves in battle, service to their deity and service to the people, so they advance through a series of 'ranks'. These are called 'Circles'. The 1st Circle is the rank of "Adamant", the second the rank of "Deriment" and the third the rank of "Deacon". Crusaders may use these titles before their name once achieved if they wish to. The actual effect of the rank skill varies depending on which Crusader type has gained it. All the ranks grant one point of damage reduction, and each grant a bonus on a statistic as follows; Bethseline - Appearance, Marial - Intelligence, Shanna - Wisdom, Merl - Willpower, Cambron - Strength, Selador - Max Health. Damage reduction means that any wound dealt to them is automatically reduced by 1 point. Higher Circles grant higher bonuses. Important Note:- The Lord Crusader of each arm of Crusaders at any time and for *any* reason, without offering any explanation if they choose not to, can remove ranks from a Crusader, demoting or stripping them of rank entirely if they so choose. The player controlling the Lord Crusader has total and utter control over this and players of Crusaders are reminded that this special class is not an easy ride, which is why they are recommended for experienced players only! There are a total of nine ranks before the Lord Crusader rank; other ones will be available later. ^ 200 ^ 20 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ Instructor ^ None ^ 25% ^ X 1530 0 Learn skill ^ ! 0 0 ^ ! 0 0 ^ ! 0 0 ^ ! 0 0
